;;; Commentary:

;; Major mode for editing execline scripts.  Features:
;;
;;   * syntax highlighting of commends, builtin commands and variable substitution.
;;   * completion of builtin commands.
;;   * working "comment-region" command.
;;   * indentation of blocks
;;   * automatic enable of mode in *.ex files.
;;
;; Missing features:
;;
;;   * adaptive indentation.  Current indentation algorithm assumes that
;;     previous line indented by same algorithm.  Trying to use indentation,
;;     provided by this mode in buffer with script, indented with another style
;;     (say, with two spaces per indentation level), causes wrong results.

;; Indenting empty line
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;;
;; Code in `execline-indent-line-function' saves current point while indenting,
;; so when user calls indention function in middle of line (e.g presses TAB),
;; point stays in same position, relative to other text in that line.
;;
;; Described behaviour is desirable in most cases, but when indenting empty
;; line, it results in indentation inserted after the point: point stays at
;; beginning of line.
;;
;; Point can also stay behind indentation if indentation function is called
;; when point is in indentation of non-empty line.
;;
;; These cases are handled specially: point is moved past indentation.

;; Assumption about previous line
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;;
;; It is assumed, that previous line is indented with tabs. This is
;; how `execline-mode' indents, but call to `indent-line' in script,
;; pre-indented with spaces lead to broken re-indentation.

(defun execline-indent-line-function ()
  "Indent line of execline script.

If previous line ends with opening brace, indent current line one
level deeper then previous line; if current line starts with
closing brace, indent current line one level shallower then
previous line; indent same as previous line otherwise."
